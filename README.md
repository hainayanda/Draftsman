# Basic Usage

Draftsman is `NSLayoutConstraints` and `UIView` hierarchy builder. The syntax is designed so it could be read just like english language.

***

## Basic
there are two method to start planning which can be called from both any `UIView` or `UIViewController`:
* `func plan(withDelegate delegate: PlanDelegate? = nil, _ options: PlanningOption = .append, _ layouter: (LayoutPlaner<Self>) -> Void)`
* `func planContent(withDelegate delegate: PlanDelegate? = nil, _ options: PlanningOption = .append, _ layouter: (LayoutPlan<Self>) -> Void)`

as you can see in the name, `plan` is used to create plan for the `UIView` or view in `UIViewController` dimension and position that called those method:

```swift
someView.plan { somePlan in
    somePlan.edges(.equal, to: .parent)
        .planContent { someViewContent in
            someViewContent.fit(otherView)
                .at(.topLeft, of: .parent)
        }
}
```

on the other hand, `planContent` could be used if you want to bypass those plan and just want to create plan for those content instead:

```swift
someView.planContent { someContentPlan in
    someContentPlan.fit(otherView)
        .at(.topLeft, of: .parent)
}
```

### PlanDelegate
You could pass `PlanDelegate` to delegate some problem which could be occurs when you are planning. The delegate is declared like this: 

```swift
public protocol PlanDelegate: class {
    func planer(viewHaveNoSuperview view: UIView) -> UIView?
    func planer(neededViewControllerFor viewController: UIViewController) -> UIViewController?
    func planer(_ view: UIView, errorWhenPlanning error: DraftsmanError)
}
```

* `planer(viewHaveNoSuperview:)` will be called if planner need superview but cannot find any. You could provide one, or just return nil to ignore those plan and produce error which can be catch at this delegate. The default is nil.
* `planer(neededViewControllerFor:)` will be called if planner need parent `UIViewController` but cannot find any. You could provide one, or just return nil to ignore those plan and produce error which can be catch at this delegate. The default is get current view UIViewController if have any.
* `planer(_:, errorWhenPlanning:)` will be called if any error occurs when planning.

### PlanningOption
PlanningOption is enumeration which will determined how the plan will be implemented:
* **append** will be ignore current active `NSLayoutConstraints` and append any `NSLayoutConstraints` planned.
* **renew** will be update same current active `NSLayoutConstraints` which created by Draftsman if found and append the new one.
* **startFresh** will be remove all current active `NSLayoutConstraints` which created by Draftsman and append any NSLayoutConstraints planned.
* **startClean** will be remove all current active `NSLayoutConstraints` and append any `NSLayoutConstraints` planned.

if we sort all the option from the fastest to the slowest it could be like this:
* append
* startClean
* startFresh
* renew

but even if the `append` is the fastest, you better just use this if you want to plan once, otherwise you will have multiple duplicated constraints.

***

## View Hierarchy
The hierarchy of View is just like how the closure declared in your code:
```swift
parentView.planContent { parentPlan in
    parentPlan.fit(someView)
        .planContent { somePlan in
            somePlan.fit(someChildView)
        }
    parentPlan.fit(otherView)
}
```
At the above code, it using `planContent` method which will bypass `parentView` plan into its content plan. It actually will do the following instruction sequentially:
1. `parentView` insert `someView`
2. `someView` insert `someChildView`
3. `parentView` insert `otherView`

So if the hierarchy is written in pseudo hierarchy style, it should be similar like this: 
```
parentView
|____someView
|    |____someChildView
|____otherView
```

where `someView` and `otherView` are both inside `parentView`, and `someChildView` is inside `someView`
the compatible type to be passed in fit method are:
* any descendant of `UIView`
* any descendant of `UIViewController`

If you pass `UIViewController`, it will be automatically added `UIViewController` view as child and put the `UIViewController` as child of its current `UIViewController`.
You could `planContent` as much as you need, it will fit all the View just like how you write it.

***

## View Position

### Basic Positioning
Positioning a View is easy. You just need to declare which anchor should have relation to others:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.top(.equal, to: other.topAnchor)
        .right(.equalTo(8), to: other.rightAnchor)
        .bottom(.moreThan, to: other.bottomAnchor)
        .left(.moreThanTo(8), to: other.leftAnchor)
        .centerX(.lessThan, to: other.centerXAnchor)
        .centerY(.lessThanTo(8), to: other.centerYAnchor)
}
```

the anatomy of position plan is:

> _func **anchor_name**(__ _relation: **LayoutRelation<CGFloat>**, to anchor: **other_anchor**, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Planner_

which `anchor_name` could be:
* **top**
* **bottom**
* **left**
* **right**
* **centerX**
* **centerY**

and `LayoutRelation` is enumeration with generic param which in this case is `CGFloat`:
* **moreThanTo(CGFloat)**
* **lessThanTo(CGFloat)**
* **equalTo(CGFloat)**
* **moreThan**
* **lessThan**
* **equal**

all the parameter is `CGFloat` that will be translated as space towards the anchor, as when the anchor is `left`, then the param will be translated as space to the left, and if the anchor is `right`, then the param will be translated as space to the right.

and `other_anchor` common types are:
* `NSLayoutYAxisAnchor`
* `NSLayoutXAxisAnchor`
* `AnonymousRelation`

the `AnonymousRelation` is enumeration which contains:
* **parent** which are where the same anchor of parent `UIView`
* **safeArea** which are where the same anchor of parent safe area `UIView`
* **myself** which are where the same anchor of current `UIView`
* **mySafeArea** which are where the same anchor of current safe area `UIView`
* **previous** which are where the same anchor of previous planned `UIView`
* **previousSafeArea** which are where the same anchor of previous planned `UIView`

You could also passing `UILayoutPriority` if you need. If you ignore it, it will be lesser than previous priority started by mandatory.

So lets say you want your view to fill the bottom of its superview, you could just use `AnonymousRelation` instead of declare explicitly:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.right(.equal, to: .parent)
        .bottom(.equal, to: .parent)
        .left(.equal, to: .parent)
}
```

### Related Anchor
If your `AnonymousRelation` anchor is different than your anchor, you could use `RelatedAnchor<NSLayoutXAxisAnchor>`. Its actually the anchor extractor from `AnonymousRelation`:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.top(.equalTo(8), to: Anchor(of: .previous).bottomAnchor)
        .right(.equal(8), to: Anchor(of: .previous).leftAnchor)
        .bottom(.equal, to: .safeArea)
        .left(.equal(8), to: .safeArea)
}
```

so instead of call the previous anchor explicitly, you call them like that.

### Positioning Shortcut
There are some shortcut for Positioning. For center anchor:
* `func center(_ relation: LayoutRelation<CoordinateOffsets>, to view: UIView, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`
* `func center(_ relation: LayoutRelation<CoordinateOffsets>, to anchor: AnonymousRelation, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`

the `CoordinateOffsets` is struct which contains `xOffset` and `yOffset`. The center is shortcut to `centerX` and `centerY`, it will automatically assign `NSLayoutConstraints` relation to same center anchor to the `UIView` or `AnonymousRelation`. Example:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.center(.equalTo(.init(xOffset: 8, yOffset: 8)), to: .parent)
}
```

For vertical and horizontal position:
* `func vertical(_ relation: LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>, to anchor: AnonymousRelation, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`
* `func vertical(_ relation: LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>, to view: UIView, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`
* `func horizontal(_ relation: LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>, to view: UIView, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`
* `func horizontal(_ relation: LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>, to anchor: AnonymousRelation, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`

the `InsetsConvertible` can be `UIEdgeInsets`, `UIVerticalInsets`, `UIHorizontalInsets`, `CGFloat`, `Int` or `Double`. Single types like `CGFloat`, `Int` or `Double` will be treated as `UIEdgeInsets` with same insets for top, left, right and bottom. The vertical will be assign top and bottom anchor to `UIView` or `AnonymousRelation` same anchors. Example:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.vertical(equalTo(16), to: .parent)
}
```

For all edges:
* `func edges(_ relation: LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>, to anchor: AnonymousRelation, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`

It will automatically assign `top`, `left`, `bottom` and `right` anchor to `UIView` or `AnonymousRelation` same anchors. Example:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.edges(.equalTo(16), to: .parent)
}
```

For any specific position:
* `func at(_ positions: [LayoutEdge], _ relation: LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>, to anchor: AnonymousRelation, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`
* `func at(_ viewRelation: RelatedPosition, _ relation: LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`
* `func inBetween(of view: UIView, and otherView: UIView, _ position: MiddlePosition, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`

Array of `LayoutEdge` have static var extensions which are:
* **topLeft** which is `[.top, .left]`
* **topRight** which is `[.top, .right]`
* **bottomLeft** which is `[.bottom, .left]`
* **bottomRight** which is `[.bottom, .right]`
* **fullLeft** which is `[.left, .top, .bottom]`
* **fullRight** which is `[.right, .top, .bottom]`
* **fullBottom** which is `[.bottom, .left, .right]`
* **fullTop** which is `[.top, .left, .right]`
* **edge** which is `[.top, .bottom, .left, .right]`

`RelatedPosition` is enumeration which are:
* **topOf(UIView)** which will mark bottom to be at top of other `UIView`
* **bottomOf(UIView)** which will mark top to be at bottom of other `UIView`
* **leftOf(UIView)** which will mark right to be at left of other `UIView`
* **rightOf(UIView)** which will mark left to be at right of other `UIView`
* **topOfAndParallelWith(UIView)** which same as `topOf`, but with same left and right as other `UIView`
* **bottomOfAndParallelWith(UIView)** which same as `bottomOf`, but with same left and right as other `UIView`
* **leftOfAndParallelWith(UIView)** which same as `leftOf`, but with same top and bottom as other `UIView`
* **rightOfAndParallelWith(UIView)** which same as `rightOf`, but with same top and bottom as other `UIView`

`MiddlePosition` is enumeration with `LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>` parameter:
* **horizontally(LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>)**
* **vertically(LayoutRelation<InsetsConvertible>)**

Example:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.at(.topLeft, .equal, to: .parent)
        .at(.rightOf(otherView), .equalTo(8))
}
otherView.plan {
    $0.inBetween(of: myView, and: anyView, .horizontally(.equalTo(8)))
}
```

***

## View Dimension

### Basic Dimensioning
Create dimension constraints for a View is easy. You just need to declare which anchor should have relation to others:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.height(.equalTo(otherView.heightAnchor), multiplyBy: 2)
        .width(.equalTo(.parent), .width)
        .height(.lessThanTo(100))
        .width(.moreThanTo(100))
}
```

The anatomy of dimension plan is:

> _func **dimension_name**(__ _relation: **InterRelation of AnonymousRelation**, __ _dimension: **LayoutDimension**, multiplyBy multiplier: CGFloat, constant: CGFloat, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Planner_

this one could be used to plan any dimension constraints with any `AnonymousRelation` dimension anchor. The other dimension plan is:

> _func **dimension_name**(__ _relation: **InterRelation of NSLayoutDimension**, multiplyBy multiplier: CGFloat, constant: CGFloat, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Planner_

this one could be used to plan any dimension constraints with any `NSLayoutDimension` anchor. The last dimension plan is:

> _func **dimension_name**(__ _relation: **InterRelation of CGFloat**, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Planner_

this one could be used to plan any dimension constraints against any constant.

The `InterRelation` is the enumeration with generic parameter:
* **moreThanTo(Related)**
* **lessThanTo(Related)**
* **equalTo(Related)**

and `LayoutDimension` is enumeration of dimension:
* **height**
* **width**

multiplier is the value which will be multiplied dimension anchor. The constant will be added to the dimension.

### Dimensioning Shortcut
There are some shortcut for Dimensioning which are:
* `func size(_ relation: InterRelation<CGSize>, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`
* `func size(_ relation: InterRelation<UIView>, multiplyBy multiplier: CGFloat = 1, constant: CGFloat = 0, priority: UILayoutPriority? = nil) -> Self`

both will automatically assign both width and height constraints towards CGSize constant or UIView size. Example:

```swift
myView.plan {
    $0.size(.equalTo(otherView), multiplyBy: 2)
}
otherView.plan {
    $0.size(.equalTo(.init(width: 24, height: 24)))
}
```

# Draftsman Fragment

Draftsman Fragment is the base of Component Based View in Draftsman. The fragment is actually just UIView, UITableViewCell and UICollectionViewCell but with planned subviews.

***

## Fragment

Fragment in Draftsman is actually an ordinary UIView (or TableViewCell/CollectionViewCell) which can do plan for itself and its subviews.

```swift
public protocol Fragment {
    func fragmentWillPlanContent()
    func planContent(_ plan: InsertablePlan)
    func fragmentDidPlanContent()
}
```
- `fragmentWillPlanContent()` will be called before `planContent(_:)` is called. its optional
- `planContent(_:)` is the mandatory method which will be called to plan the content of Fragment.
- `fragmentDidPlanContent()` will be called after `planContent(_:)` is called. its optional

The mechanism is very straightforward. lets say you have this simple fragment:

```swift
class MySimpleFragment: UIView, Fragment {
    var marginedButton: UIButton = .init()

    var margin = UIEdgeInsets(insets: 8)

    func planContent(_ plan: InsertablePlan) {
        plan.fit(marginedButton).edges(equalTo(margin), to: .parent)
    }
}
```

to put it in ViewController bottom edges:

```swift
class MySimpleViewController: UIViewController {
    var simpleFragment: MySimpleFragment = .init()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        planContent { plan in
            plan.fit(simpleFragment)
                .at(.fullBottom, .equal, to: .parent)
        }
}
```

what happening here is when you fit simpleFragment into view, it will call simpleFragment's `planContent(_:)` where the `InsertablePlan` is the simpleFragment's `LayoutPlaner`. If it's described as hierarchal pseudocode and where the part is executed. It will be looked like this: 

* viewDidLoad
> * planContent
> > * fit simpleFragment inside view
> > > * add simpleFragment as subviews of view controller view
> > > * create LayoutPlaner with simpleFragment as its view
> > > * call simpleFragment's `fragmentWillPlanContent()` method which not implemented so its doing nothing
> > > * call simpleFragment's `planContent(_:)` method
> > > > * fit marginedButton inside simpleFragment
> > > > * create edges contraints
> > > * call simpleFragment's `fragmentDidPlanContent()` method which not implemented so its doing nothing
> > * create fullBottom constraints
> > * activate all constraints created inside

The simpleFragment's `planContent(_:)` will be called inside `fit(_:)` so all its subviews constraints will already be created after `fit(_:)` is called.

There are two other extensions method you could use to call planContent indirectly:
* `func planFragment(delegate: PlanDelegate? = nil)` which will be call `fragmentWillPlanContent()`, `planContent(_:)` and `fragmentDidPlanContent()` and activate all created constraints right away
* `func replanContent(delegate: PlanDelegate? = nil)` which will remove all its and subviews constraints which created by Draftsman and call `planFragment(delegate:)`

***

## Fragment Cell

There is Fragment created specially for cell which named `FragmentCell`:

```swift
public protocol FragmentCell: Fragment {
    var layoutPhase: CellLayoutingPhase { get }
    var planningBehavior: CellPlanningBehavior { get }
    func planningOption(on phase: CellLayoutingPhase) -> PlanningOption
}
```

You're not supposed to implement FragmentCell by yourself but by extend `TableFragmentCell` which is `UITableViewCell` that implement `FragmentCell` or `CollectionFragmentCell` which is `UICollectionViewCell` that implement `FragmentCell`. The reason is because all of the `FragmentCell` implementation is implemented there as part of how those `FragmentCell` should behave.

### Behavior and Phase

As we could see before, the `FragmentCell` have two properties and one added method:
* `var layoutPhase: CellLayoutingPhase { get }`
* `var planningBehavior: CellPlanningBehavior { get }`
* `func planningOption(on phase: CellLayoutingPhase) -> PlanningOption`

The `layoutPhase` is the phase of the Cell, which is enumeration:
* **firstLoad** which indicated that the `Cell` is just created
* **setNeedsLayout** which indicated that the `Cell` `setNeedsLayout()` is just called
* **reused** which indicated that the `Cell` is being reused
* **none

the `planningBehavior` is the behavior of the cell during layouting which could be overridden if needed. It is enumeration which contains:
* **planOnce** which will only call `planContent(_:)` during `firstLoad` phase
* **planOn(CellLayoutingPhase)** which will only call `planContent(_:)` during the given `CellLayoutingPhase`
* **planOnEach([CellLayoutingPhase])** which will only call `planContent(_:)` during each given `CellLayoutingPhase`
* **planIfPossible** which will always call `planContent(_:)` for any `CellLayoutingPhase`

the `planningOption(on:)` will be called before `planContent(_:)` is called by any phase. It will asked what `PlanningOption` you want to use when call `planContent(_:)`. The default is append when `firstLoad` phase and `starFresh` on the other phases. You could read more about `PlanningOption` [here](https://github.com/nayanda1/Draftsman/wiki/Draftsman-Plan#planningoption). Example:

```swift
class EventCollectionCell: CollectionFragmentCell {
    override var planningBehavior: CellPlanningBehavior { .planIfPossible }

    lazy var imageView: UIImageView = .init()
    
    override func planContent(_ plan: InsertablePlan) {
        plan.fit(imageView)
            .edges(.equal, to: .parent)
    }

    override func planningOption(on phase: CellLayoutingPhase) -> PlanningOption {
        switch phase {
        case .firstLoad:
            return .append
        default:
            return .renew
        }
    }
}
```

Cell at the example above will always call `planContent(_:)` at any phases, but will only do `append` on `firstLoad` and the rest will be `renew` the current constraints.

If you want to manually call `planContent(_:)` during any phases, you could just call `layoutContentIfNeeded()` it will layout content if the current phase is whitelisted in `planningBehavior` and return `Bool` indicated that the `planContent(_:)` is called or not.

### Table Fragment Cell

`TableFragmentCell` is the `UITableViewCell` that implement `FragmentCell`. Other than what `UITableViewCell`, `Fragment` and `FragmentCell` feature, it have one method that  could help you determine cell dimension:

**func calculatedCellHeight(for cellWidth: CGFloat) -> CGFloat**

`cellWidth` is the width of the cell which already calculated according to the tableView content width and insets. The default return value is automatic, but it could be came in handy if the cell `NSLayoutConstraints` alone cannot give the exact dimension of the cell. Example:

```swift
class MyCell: TableFragmentCell {
    lazy var collectionLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout = .init()
    lazy var collectionView: UICollectionView = .init(frame: .zero, collectionViewLayout: collectionLayout)
    
    override func fragmentWillPlanContent() {
        collectionView.allowsSelection = true
        collectionView.backgroundColor = .clear
        collectionView.allowsSelection = true
        collectionLayout.scrollDirection = .horizontal
        collectionLayout.itemSize = .init(width: .x64, height: .x48)
        collectionLayout.minimumInteritemSpacing = .zero
        collectionLayout.minimumLineSpacing = .zero
    }
    
    override func planContent(_ plan: InsertablePlan) {
        plan.fit(collectionView)
            .edges(.equal, to: .parent)
    }
    
    override func calculatedCellHeight(for cellWidth: CGFloat) -> CGFloat {
        128
    }
}
```

If you want to inject cellSize calculator, just pass closure to `whenNeedCellSize` method at cell

```swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath) as! TableFragmentCell
    cell.whenNeedCellSize { width in
        return 128
    }
    return cell
}
```

Cell above will have height 128 regarding of how long is cellWidth.

### Collection Fragment Cell

`CollectionFragmentCell` is the `UICollectionViewCell` that implement `FragmentCell`. Other than what `UICollectionViewCell`, `Fragment` and `FragmentCell` feature, it have one method that  could help you determine cell dimension:

**func calculatedCellSize(for collectionContentSize: CGSize) -> CGSize**

`collectionContentSize` is the size of the calculated collectionView content minus insets. The default return value is automatic, but it could be came in handy if the cell `NSLayoutConstraints` alone cannot give the exact dimension of the cell. Example:

```swift
class EventCollectionCell: CollectionFragmentCell {
    lazy var imageView: UIImageView = .init()
    
    override func planContent(_ plan: InsertablePlan) {
        plan.fit(imageView)
            .edges(.equal, to: .parent)
    }
    
    override func calculatedCellSize(for collectionContentSize: CGSize) -> CGSize {
        return .init(width: collectionContentSize.width / 3, height: collectionContentSize.width / 3)
    }
}
```

Cell above will be square with side equal to 1/3 `collectionContentSize` side

If you want to inject cellSize calculator, just pass closure to `whenNeedCellSize` method at cell

```swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath) as! TableFragmentCell
    cell.whenNeedCellSize { collectionContentSize in
        return .init(width: collectionContentSize.width / 3, height: collectionContentSize.width / 3)
    }
    return cell
}
```
