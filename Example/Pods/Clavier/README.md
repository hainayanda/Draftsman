# Basic Usage

Clavier is the Keyboard Layout Guide created to make constraints to the keyboard. It will automatically change on the keyboard changes. It calculates the intersection frame of the Keyboard and the `UIView`. As you can see in the picture below:

![alt text](https://github.com/hainayanda/Clavier/blob/main/KeyboardUp.png)

If the keyboard did not intersect with the view, it will always use the most bottom of the `UIView` with zero height for the regular one, or most bottom of the safe area when using a safe one

If the keyboard is hidden, it will always use the most bottom of the UIView with zero height for the regular one, or most bottom of the safe area when using a safe one

## Usage

To use Clavier, just use `clavierLayoutGuide` from any `UIView`, or `safeClavierLayoutGuide` if you prefer the one intersect with the safe area. it is an instance of `ClavierLayoutGuide` class which extend `UILayoutGuide` so it has all its anchors, like `topAnchor`, `leadingAnchor`, etc:

```swift
myView.bottomAnchor.constraints(equalTo: mySuperview.clavierLayoutGuide.topAnchor)
```

or with safe area:

```swift
myView.bottomAnchor.constraints(equalTo: mySuperview.safeClavierLayoutGuide.topAnchor)
```

myView will automatically move according to keyboard layout guide frame changes.

Since its subclass of UILayoutGuide, it has layoutFrame which is the intersection frame with keyboard frame, if you need it:

```swift
let frameIntersectWithKeyboard: CGRect = view.clavierLayoutGuide.layoutFrame
```

or with safe area:

```swift
let frameIntersectWithKeyboard: CGRect = view.safeClavierLayoutGuide.layoutFrame
```

***

## iOS 15

On iOS 15, Clavier will defaultly use `keyboardLayoutGuide` from UIKit. on `safeClavierLayoutGuide`, it will use custom class that utilize `keyboardLayoutGuide` and `safeAreaLayoutGuide`

You can explicitly disable iOS 15 `keyboardLayoutGuide` if you want by set directly with the view or by using global config.

```swift
myView.usingAppleKeyboardLayoutGuideIfAvailable = false

// or to apply as default with all view

ClavierGlobalConfig.usingAppleKeyboardLayoutGuideIfAvailable = false
```
